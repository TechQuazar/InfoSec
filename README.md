# Information Security and Privacy Assignments

This repository contains assignments completed under the guidance of Professor Mo Satt as part of the **Information Security and Privacy (CS-GY6813)** course. These assignments focus on understanding security mechanisms, implementing access control, and testing security layers through a **reference monitor**.

## Assignment 1: Implementing a Reference Monitor

### Objective
This assignment focuses on **creating a reference monitor** using the **security layer functionality in Repy V2**. A **reference monitor** is an **access control mechanism** that mediates access between subjects (users/processes) and objects (resources/files).

### Key Learnings:
- Understanding the **concept of access control** and **security layers**.
- Implementing a **reference monitor** to **allow, deny, or modify** access to system calls.
- Creating **test cases** to verify the effectiveness of the security layer.

### Implementation:
- Used **Repy V2 security layer** to implement an access control system.
- Enforced **policy-based restrictions** on system calls.
- Developed **test cases** to validate security policies.

## Assignment 2: Attacking a Reference Monitor

### Objective
This assignment involves testing and **attacking a reference monitor** implemented in **Repy V2** to evaluate its security. The goal is to understand **how adversaries may attempt to bypass security layers** and strengthen security mechanisms.

### Key Learnings:
- Identifying **potential vulnerabilities** in access control mechanisms.
- Developing **test cases** that simulate **adversarial attacks** on a security layer.
- Strengthening security mechanisms through **robust security testing**.

### Implementation:
- Designed and executed **test cases** to **probe for security flaws**.
- Explored **bypass techniques** used by adversaries to break security layers.
- Analyzed **security weaknesses** and proposed **improvements** for enhanced protection.

## Technologies Used
- **Repy V2** (Restricted Python for security experiments)
- **Security Layer Framework**
- **Encasement Library**
- **Testbed: Seattle Testbed**

## Conclusion
These assignments provided hands-on experience in **security mechanisms, access control, and adversarial testing**. By implementing and attacking a **reference monitor**, I gained practical insights into **information security paradigms** and **privacy protection**.
